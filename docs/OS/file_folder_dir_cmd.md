# File, Folder, Directory and Commands for Console

A console is a ***command-line interface*** that allows users to interact with the computer's operating system through `text commands`. 

It is a powerful tool that can be used for various purposes, such as managing 

- files,
- folders and directories.

Here are some essential concepts related to file, folder, and directory management:

- [File](./file.md): A file is a collection of data that is stored on a computer. It can be a document, an image, a video, or any other type of data.
- [Folder and Directory](./folderNdirectory.md): A folder is a container for files and other folders. A directory is a hierarchical structure that organizes files and folders into a tree-like structure.
- [Path (경로)](./path.md): A path is a string of characters that represents the location of a file or folder in the file system.
- [Disk, Partition, and Volume](./disk_partition_volume.md): The disk is the primary storage device of a computer. A partition is a logical division of the disk, and a volume is a logical unit of storage within a partition.
- [기타 명령어 (Windows)](./windows_cmds.md): Windows provides various console commands that can be used to manage files, folders, and directories. These commands include dir, cd, md, rd, copy, move, and del.
